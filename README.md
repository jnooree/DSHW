# DSHW

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to 2020-1 Data Structure HWs. Scores were
as followings:

| Homework | Score (out of 100) |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| HW1      | 100                |
| HW2      | 100                |
| HW3      | 100                |
| HW4      | 95[^1]             |
| HW5      | 100                |
| HW6      | 99[^2]             |

[^1]: Due to the report. No deduction from my code.
[^2]: Failed on a single test case.

Note that the code was written when I had just started to study software and
computer engineering (I didn't even hear of OOP at that time), so not as good
as my current code.
